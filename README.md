Job Vacancy Scraper
Hi people, this repository is created to help you guys to scrape any website with listing job vacancy, 
Why ? because this was built to help my friend who has a dream to work at a tech company and already subscribe to their new job newsletter but the fact is they never send any new opening job to his email, with this a friend of mine can have notification when there is an opening vacancy on a website company.


#### Quick Start
* install Node
* install `yarn` or `npm`
* Running `yarn start`
